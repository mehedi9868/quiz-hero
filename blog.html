                    find()
                    method?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg font-normal">All four methods are array methods but their purpose are diffrent. map()
                    loops through an array elements and do something (according the code) and returns a new array.

                    filter() loops through an array elements and based upon the condition it returns a new array. This
                    array
                    contains only elements that passed the condition.

                    forEach() method loops through an array elements and do something (according the code) but returns
                    nothing.

                    find() method loops through an array elements and based upon the condition it finds out the first
                    matched element that passed the condition and returns the element directly.

                    storage
                    and cookies?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg font-normal">
                    Local storage, session storage, and cookies are used to store data in a user's web browser.

                    Local storage is similar to cookies, but the data is stored on the user's browser permanently
                    or until the user clears their browser data. This means that the data can be accessed even after
                    the user closes and reopens their browser.

                    Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the duration of the user's
                    browsing session. Once the user closes their browser, the data is deleted.

                    Cookies are small pieces of data that websites can store on a user's browser. They can be used for
                    things like remembering login information or tracking website usage.

            <!-- question 3 -->
            <div class="bg-orange-50 w-3/4 mx-auto p-10 rounded-lg mb-4">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Question 3: What is event loop? How does it work?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg font-normal">
                    The event loop is a part of JavaScript's runtime environment that manages the execution of code. It
                    works by constantly checking the call stack to see if there are any functions that need to be
                    executed. If the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the task queue to see if there are any
                    pending tasks.

                    When a function is called, it is added to the call stack. If the function calls another function,
                    that function is added to the call stack on top of the previous one. When a function finishes
                    executing, it is removed from the call stack.

                    If there are any asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server that need to be
                    executed, they are added to the task queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop takes the
                    first task from the task queue and adds it to the call stack to be executed.
